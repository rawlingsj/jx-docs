We're having a Jenkins X hackathon in Lisbon on December 2! The hackathon is free to attend and will be a joint hackathon with the [Jenkins project](https://jenkins.io/).

[Register here](https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/266201129) to participate in the hackathon. All levels of contributors are welcome!

Please note this hackathon takes place the day before [the Jenkins X Contributor Summit](/blog/2019/10/18/jenkins-x-contributor-summit-lisbon/), which is also free to attend and we would love to see you at both.

These events are being organised for the community in the days prior to [DevOps World | Jenkins World Lisbon](https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/lisbon). We realised many Jenkins X and Jenkins community members will be attending the conference and  wanted to create additional opportunities for community members to meet and collaborate. 

A [DevOps World | Jenkins World](https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/lisbon) conference pass is not necessary to attend the hackathon or [the Jenkins X Contributor Summit](/blog/2019/10/18/jenkins-x-contributor-summit-lisbon/). However, if you are planning on attending DevOps World | Jenkins World, the conference organizers are offering a 30% discount on registration with code **JWFOSS**.


**Hackathon Agenda:**

* 9:00 am - Welcome with coffee/pastries
* 9:30 am - Introductions & topic discussions
* 10:30 am - Hacking starts
* 12:00 pm - Lunch
* 1:00 pm - More hacking
* 5:00 pm - Wrap-up

Hope to see you there! 

Remember to [register](https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/266201129) if you can attend.
