With sponsorship from the [CDF (Continuous Delivery Foundation)](https://cd.foundation/), Jenkins X is participating in the [Outreachy mentorship program](https://www.outreachy.org/). This is the first time that Jenkins X will be participating in Outreachy and we are fortunate to be working with such a phenomenal organisation. You can read more about our decision to participate in Outreachy [here](/blog/2019/10/01/outreachy2019/).

We're excited to announce that an intern has been selected! [Neha Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neha-gup/) will be working with us to create a cloud storage backed Helm repository for Jenkins X to replace ChartMuseum.

We are grateful for the contributions that we received from all applicants. While we can only offer one paid internship at this time, [our community](/community/) is willing to help all newcomers to the Jenkins X project to learn and grow in their skills.

Welcome to the team, Neha! ðŸŽ‰
