### Try out Jenkins X quickly

If you're looking to take Jenkins X for a spin (or not interested in running it yourself) the quickest way to get up and running, is using the [CloudBees CI-CD powered by Jenkins X](https://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-ci-cd/overview) which is a SaaS running on Jenkins X.

<!--
The simplest way to get started is via the [Google Cloud Tutorials](/docs/managing-jx/tutorials/google-hosted/). -->

### Get setup locally

First you will need to [get the jx command line tool](/docs/getting-started/setup/install/) locally on your machine.

Then you can use the [jx command line](/commands/jx/#jx) to [create a new Kubernetes cluster](/docs/getting-started/setup/create-cluster/) with Jenkins X installed automatically.

If you already have a Kubernetes cluster, then [install Jenkins X on your Kubernetes cluster with Jenkins X Boot](/docs/getting-started/setup/boot/).

### Once you have Jenkins X set up and running

When you have a Kubernetes cluster with Jenkins X installed, check out [your next steps](/docs/getting-started/next/).

## Other options

In case you're looking for something else than straight up Jenkins X, there are a few options:

* [CloudBees Jenkins X Distribution](https://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-jenkins-x-distribution/overview) - monthly releases, battle tested and verified by CloudBees. Optional [commercial support](https://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-jenkins-x-support/overview) is available as well for extra piece of mind
* [CloudBees CI-CD powered by Jenkins X](https://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-ci-cd/overview) - CI/CD as a service so you don't need to worry about setting up and manage Jenkins X
